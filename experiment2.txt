We forgot about the overrall rules of the game,
because our modified_bot prioritized the middle slot whenever it was empty, the enemy bot would be able to make a move in the middle section of the board

This meant that the opponent got overall middle control of the board which lead to more wins.

However, because when you reduce the nubmer of nodes each bot has, the choices become more random. this leads the modified_bot improving slightly as the more random the choices become the
better the middle tile is as a choice.
